# Analysis of an HSNC Dataset

## Data Loading & Preprocessing
1. Pathway Enrichment Analysis
2. Testing for Normality of Gene Distributions

## Hierarchical Clustering
1. Testing for Sample Cluster Enrichment
2. Compare Clustering Results w/ and w/o Optimal Leaf Ordering

## Classification (Random Forest)
1. Feature Selection  
2. Random Forest: 20 balanced features in the training (10-fold cross validation)  
3. Random Forest: 50 balanced features in the training (10-fold cross validation)  
4. Random Forest: 100 balanced features in the training (10-fold cross validation)  
5. Random Forest: 500 balanced features in the training (10-fold cross validation)
